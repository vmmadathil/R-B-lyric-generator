part time love is the life 'round here
we're never done
now we’re at square one
life ain't been 'round here in a minute
here ain't been 'round my whole life
and we waited too long
chaos been 'round for a minute
marketed, bottled it up
but wear that fake smile like a cape
save yourself first, save yourself first
 
 
don't wanna see you by yourself, by yourself
by yourself, by yourself, by yourself
 
aw, girl, your face is saying, "why?"
tears in eyes
should've been more smart about it
should've cherished me, listening to friends
now it's the end
and again, no story can end without it
 
keep downing drinks like there's no tomorrow
there's just right, now, now, now
now, now, now, now
gon' set the roof on fire
gonna burn this motherf down, down, down
down, down, down, down 
 
if you're coming with me, really coming with me
you go get some girls and bring them to me
if you're coming with me, really coming with me
you let her put her hands in your pants, be my little freak
be my little freak, be my little freak
you let her put her hands in your pants, be my little freak
if you're coming with me, really coming with me
you let her put her hands in your pants, be my little freak
 
i don't wanna give you the wrong impression

going nowhere fast
we've reached the climax
we're together, now we're undone
won't commit, so we choose to run away
do we separate?
oh, don't wanna give in, so we both gave up
can't take it back, it's too late, we've reached the climax

part time love is the life 'round here
we're never done
everything feels like touchdown on a rainy day
part time love is the life 'round here
we're never done
everything feels like touchdown on a rainy day
now we’re at square one
and we waited too long
so we’re back to square one
 
you can't return the sacred time you steal
the fact betrays the way you feel
and the sight delays the right to heal
you decide to stay long

couldn't they see what you could do, everyone?
i know it took you a while to get to california
i had no idea I was waiting on you

i'm on that ledge, she grabs my arm
she slaps my hand
it's good times, yeah

the market's down like 60 stories
and some don't end the way they should
my silver spoon has fed me good
a million one, a million cash
close my eyes and feel the crash
 
i thought that I was dreaming when you said you love me
the start of nothin', I had no chance to prepare
i couldn't see you comin'
the start of nothin', ooh, I could hate you now
it's quite alright to hate me now
but we both know that deep down
the feeling still deep down is good
 
the best song wasn't the single, but you weren't either
living in ladera heights, the black beverly hills
domesticated paradise, palm trees and pools
the water's blue, swallow the pill
keeping it surreal, whatever you like
whatever feels good, whatever takes your mountain high
keeping it surreal, not sugar-free
my tv ain't hd, that's too real
grapevine, mango, peaches, and limes, the sweet life
 
how many drinks would it take you to leave with me?
yeah you look good, and I got money
but I don't wanna waste my time

this shower head feels so amazing
we'll both be high, the help don't stare

a million one, a million two
a hundred more will never do
 
it's seven o'clock on the dot
i'm in my drop top, cruising the streets, ah yeah
i got a real pretty, pretty little thing that's waiting for me
i pull up, anticipating
good love, don't keep me waiting
i got plans to put my hands in places
i never seen, girl, you know what I mean
 
will the waters ever still? that's what I want
and with every inhalation I'm further up
'til I can only see the outline of the storm
from space I can see that I was wrong
power on, power on
power on
power on
power on
 
let me tell you, girl, before you go
yeah, there's a few things you should know
i'm still struggling with the dos and don'ts
but I felt compelled to let you know that you a
 
find light in the beautiful sea
i choose to be happy
you and i, you and i
we're like diamonds in the sky
you're a shooting star I see
a vision of ecstasy
when you hold me, I'm alive
we're like diamonds in the sky
 
adrenaline pumpin', heart pacing racing, altercations, we lit
blood drip stain the ground, boy get down, you hit
same hood, different day, same whip, different clip
letting off, somehow we end up in the same shit
 
yo, I ain't seen you in a minute
but I got something to tell you

and you know, you know
and you know, in this foreign car, let it go
and you know, you know
and you know, in this foreign car, let you know
 
aha, and what do we have
your empty heart and my empty bottle and yellow cab
that you are likely to catch 'cause your latest ex made you mad
so I figured the perfect catch would be you if I made the pass
pool full of liquor then we dive - in it
knowing if I lick her I might die - in it
then reincarnate as a fly - gymnast
just to flip my tongue on you
this the olympics
 
and it hurts 'cause I wanna leave
and you wanna leave, but the love keeps us together
and if I lose you, I'm afraid I would lose who, who I gave my love to
that's the reason I stay around, even though I fell way
 
i said I just want someone real, someone true

 
or do you not think so far ahead?
'cause I been thinking bout forever, ooh
or do you not think so far ahead?
'cause I been thinking bout forever, ooh

and not because I buy you those expensive purses
but because the love you got for me is permanent
he threw me up under the bus, he say I'm undeserving
don't give him no encouragement
i had to soak in some things, I needed nourishment
look at me now, see a nigga really flourishing
i wouldn't trade my old life for my current one

a 'ventador for a huracan
why trade a good woman for a' immature one?
or a gold digger for an entrepreneur

be true to you, that's something I don't do enough
cut me off, shawty, I thought you was bluffing

w. e. b. du bois, I'm the modern one
yelling at senators, presidents, congressmen
we got a problem that needs some acknowledgement
i am no prison commodity, not just a body you throw in a cell
for any reason, just to bother me
just for your quota, so it's rest in peace to sean bell
sleep in peace eric garner 
every street, every corner
conspiracy, new world order
i spoke to tamir rice mom and she told me "be strong"
it won't be long 'til it's justice
they won't have votes but refuse the discussion
on how certain cops they shoot us for nothing
revolution is coming

cheers to the girls, throw a deuce to the guys
now I got a chicken and a goose in the ride
getting loose in the ride
hating ass nigga you can move to the, move to the, move to the side
 
this is a lonely off-white room
i keep my gaze on you, while other people move
where you lead me I will go
it's the thorns I want
and the bloom I always fear
tell me when I have to go
and then love me there
tell me when I have to go
and then love me there
 
i said, now I don't need a model

just be a tough act to follow
and you know, a free spirit, with a wild heart, alright

 
tell me, would you please
i know you still love me, yeah
tell me, baby girl, tell me
i know you care for me
 
i find it funny how niggas start talking money
i'm living lovely, apartment far from the bunjee
i remember us living not too far from the junkies, the flunkees
that tried to punk me on corners but never sunk me
i swear, in this bitch, yeah I'm killing this year
them boys hated, they gon' feel it this year
i bought a 'rari, I only drove in it once, I'm moving different this year
i'm leaving thousands, talking millions this year
when niggas really talkin', talking over, talk it over
renegotiate and make the play and they cough it over
i crossed over like iverson when he dropped the shoulder on jordan
the feeling more than the sport when you winning fuck how they feelin'
the feelings got left aside, I told them to step aside
i'm really eatin', I'm ordering  extra sides, you know me
'round the block, glovers spitting them hot flows
my sense smells like michelle was touching barack's clothes
presidential, the flow is so evidential
at the clearport customs, I barely show my credentials
don't need it tinted, I want you to know who's in it
had me offended last time that I walked in the holt renfrew
let's break it down for 'em, account this
if every show is a hunnid thou' for him then that mean
a hunnid minutes on stage will equal a hunnid k
that's one thousand a minute so please don't get offended
if I walk inside a store and spend thirty-five in it
'cause, to me, that's just thirty-five minutes
land in jamaica, sip on a guinness and get it
who wanna witness, my nigga? I'm really sick with the shiznit
i brought big poppy out at the sumfest
sean kingston watched it from the side stage
i made triple the advance that he had gave me in my first year
forty-five minutes of me on stage
and I'm not amazed, I think the tables turnin'
i think you learn from the bridge you burn when you see it burnin'
i think you learn from the world when you see it turnin'
i went from being a server to being this platinum deserver, you feel me?
did a song with meek milly, called it "litty"
really I just did that shit for the city in love with philly
god, this chinchilla fur on me, just in case it gets chilly
burner on my side pocket, just that's in case you get illy out here
me and travis scott almost fought at the mala luna
we both agreed shortly after that it was music
we possibly could be doing that's bigger than tryna ruin it
so my apologies, nigga, just forgive me for doing it
history made in new york city, we called a truce at the tower
i only brought a couple niggas with me
the beef was finished as soon as we took the picture, the world was watchin'
the attention in the industry started shifting to me
lord forgive 'em, lord forgive 'em, I was tripping all the time
i spit subliminal dissin', just tryna rip shit
not realizing if I took the time to kick it and me and drake mending bridges it'd probably equal to winnin'
got the hardhead flow, money come in so thick
them niggas call it hard bread dough
i'm in this all red four seater, I'm leaning like the '06 fours
i said I'd stop freestyling but fuck it, oh well
a nigga flow so well, I'm like a sampling kit
give a fuck 'bout who get pissed about by samples and skits
niggas mad I'm remixing they shit-pshh
fuck out of here, nigga, stop being a bitch
i think it's time we cut the silence by niggas that's talking violent
speak of silence and give 'em coffins and violins playin'
r&b niggas with sisqó haircuts, wilding and stylin'
they dissin', guess they just tryna go viral, I feel 'em
this your favorite song, this gon' be your favorite song
'cept when I say it, it's really the people's favorite song
you did a vid dissing to flex the i8
i could've flexed a 'rari or wraith, but nigga, I ain't
instead, I bought my house the other day, I'm flexed in the paint
real estate, I'm property shoppin', bitches probably watchin'
got the gadget-go flow, nobu and so-ho
i've been crossed by some niggas I used to go toe-to-toe for
blow for blow flow, sick enough to eat a blowfish
g5 jet playing go-fish, eating gold fish
just for the record, I did this shit for the hopeless
just drove a rolls through the hood on the corner where I was homeless
it's fargo
 
wilding on my haters 
in my 23s, having a jordan moment
wilding with the paper 
ice all on my chain, I'ma...
i just popped two, I'll be staying up 
hanging with the gang, that shit dangerous, yeah
i can't fuck you with my chains, that shit tangle up, yeah
come and catch a wave, take one out my cup, yeah

damn the police, woah 
wilding in sv, yeah 
moving up your street, yeah 
when we on the creek
and bring sand to the beach 
ain't no day, ain't no night
made no plans, ain't no sleep
yeah, yeah
 
so if that is how it is
i don’t wanna be a star
but a stone on the shore
a lone doorframe in a wall
when everything’s overgrown
but what she really really wanted was my rights and my wrongs
and I wouldn’t understand but I would try playing along
and I wouldn’t understand but I would try playing along
and I wouldn’t understand but I would try playing along

a sweet life
a sweet life, yeah

live and die in the life
 
and she don't fuck with niggas 'cause niggas is the reason
she got herself inside of this situation in the first place
brooklyn myrtle ave. is her birth place
facing the city, quoting biggie on all her worst days
i used to take the train with her so none of these lames get her
the danger of living from where she was at was a plain picture
i used to paint pictures on how we could gain riches together
instead of listen, she kinda just blew me off
paid it no mind but it kind of just threw me off
i guess I figured everybody want riches and of course
but she just wanted a better family because her parents divorced
early, her papa, he was taken by the force
mother on crack and she never had time to bathe her
'stead she gave her to her uncle, her brother who played the savior
'til the day he started dating this chick
that had put him up on mad pills and fucking up mad bills
she told me that one night he had got so fucked up
he fell asleep on his sofa, then woke up a new persona
and walked inside of her room and told her remove her clothing
and forcefully started choking her and telling her not to move
'fore she could even finish, she broke out in tears and did it
told me that for years, this night was a repetition, a feeling of fear
that she couldn't seem to exit or quit it, the feeling was there
started talking lower as she told me come here
she said she had to make choices
so she got involved with niggas that make noise with them thangs, you feel
ran off in her uncle's spot with the stainless steel
put the burner to his face with this aim to kill
and said, she don't fuck with niggas 'cause niggas is the reason
she got herself inside of this situation in the first place
figured that this intimidation was the worst case
she sat back and blew six in that boy face gun shots
shot, him, dead

so low that I don't get high no more
when I "geronimo!," I just go "heh"
solo, my cup is a rojo, my cholo, my friend
so low that I can admit
when I hear that another kid is shot by the popo
it ain't an event no more
so low that no more high horses, so hard to wear polo
when I do, I cut the pony off
now there's a hole where there once was a logo, how fitting
so low that I can give a fuck about what is trending
tryna cut down on my spending
regardless of winning, instead of pretending
and bending over backwards
over half of these hoes had work done
saying they want something real from a man
just saying it, we being real persons
i hate that it's like this, I feel for you, and
i don't know what it's like with a skirt on
so pardon me if I am being insensitive
but darling this only worsens
so low my halo stay way low, it feels like it's bent
so low that when they throw pussy or pesos
i pay no attention to it
so low that I am no rookie but feel like a kid
looking at the other kids
with astonishment while I'm on punishment
watching the summer come close to an end
after 20 years in, I'm so naïve I was under the impression
that everyone wrote they own verses
it's coming back different and, yeah, that shit hurts me
i'm humming and whistling to those not deserving
i've stumbled and lived every word
was I working just way too hard?
 
even though you're all alone

unless you're down to do this publicly
girl you know you, know you gotta get comfortable
all the dogs here, run with me
and I fuck with you
so if you really fuck with me
get as freaky as you wanna be, girl it's up to you
and she hit me with that "i don't do this normally, but for you I'll make exceptions"
well, let's see what's next then
 
you know how I feel about like... us, right?

and I know that it's hard to digest
but maybe your story ain’t so different from the rest
and I know it seems wrong to accept
but you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
and I know that it's hard to digest
a realization is as good as it gets
and I know it seems wrong to accept
but you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
but you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
 
every time I was in l.a., I was with my ex-girlfriend
every time you called, I told you, "baby, I'm working"
 I was out doing my dirt
 wasn't thinking 'bout you getting hurt
 was hand-in-hand in the beverly center like, man
not giving a damn who sees me
so gone, so wrong
acting like I didn't have you sitting at home
thinking about me
being the good girl that you are
i bet you probably believe you got a good man
a man that never would do the things I'm about to tell you I've done
brace yourself, it ain't good
but it would be even worse if you heard this from somebody else
 
but it wanders 'til I'm high up
where I'm not all here, and there's no karma
when you touch me, I wonder
i always wonder what you could want with me
 
if you wanna scream, “yeah”, oh

you was born a goddess, I made you my queen
which mean we upgraded to louis the thirteen
hot tottie, her poppy like cognac

when your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
but you know gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't
jumping like it used to, even though this might bruise you
let it burn, let it burn, gotta let it burn
deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
hate the thought of her being with someone else
but you know that it's over, we knew it was through
let it burn, let it burn, gotta let it burn
 
if you're coming with me, really coming with me

let's go back to the beginning
let's cover up this broken love treason
 
i have a hard time, opening up to people
i get closed off
i just, I feel that by being emotional in front of someone
it makes me weak and vulnerable and
whenever, I truly loved anybody
they've always stabbed me in the back
 
young nigga, young nigga
your friends bad too?
then tell 'em come with you 
and we like, bitches with they own shit
we don't like gold diggers
 
and as it keeps going
if there's no need for the perfect image
and nothing seems that wrong
don't miss it
when you know there's better conversation waiting for you at home
and as it keeps on going
you forget whether it was the beginning or end
when you can't believe your luck
you're with your friend
when you get to hang out with your favourite person every day
when the dull pain goes away
don't miss it 
when you stop being a ghost in a shell
and everybody keeps saying you look well
don't miss it
like I did
don't miss it
don't miss it like I did
like I did

i believe that marriage isn't
between a man and woman but between love and love
and I believe you when you say that you've lost all faith
but you must believe in something, something, something
you gotta believe in something, something, something

if you
 
i ain't been 'round here in a minute
but you ain't been 'round a whole lot
my flesh went through the peoples in this peephole
and sealed the keyhole and kept the door locked
part time love is the life 'round here
and wear that fake smile like a cape
save yourself first, save yourself first
part-time love is the life 'round here
we're never done...
save yourself first
 
i'm not waiting at home for you
bye bye
 
what I have will believe you until now
even doing nothing I am making the most of somehow
and the credit goes to her
as the bad days become rare
gotta keep her in my sights
gotta keep her in my life
 
we flow, we flow, we flow, we flow 
can't believe the way we flow
we flow, we flow, we flow, we flow 
can’t believe the way we flow
we flow, we flow, we flow, we flow 
can't believe the way we flow
we flow, we flow, we flow, we flow 
can't believe the way we flow
 
i'd do anything for you
i'd do anything for you
i'd do anything for you
i'd do anything for you
i'd do anything for you, anything for you
i'd do anything for you, anything for
 
don't wanna see you by yourself, by yourself
by yourself, by yourself, by yourself
 
the way it felt no faking it
maybe we were moving just a little too fast
but what we've done, we can't take it back

 
i'm sure we're taller in another dimension
you say we're small and not worth the mention
you’re tired of movin', your body's achin'
we could vacay, there's places to go
clearly this isn't all that there is
can't take what's been given
but we're so okay here, we're doing fine
primal and naked
you dream of walls that hold us in prison
it's just a skull, least that's what they call it
and we're free to roam
 
my pockets snug, they can't hold my 7
they banned my visa, my amex and mastercards
i got new money, and it's all cash
i got new bags, and they all collabs
i rubber band a bunch of thousand-dollar delta gift cards
amazing, the cash online unknown
blazing the dash, counting money at home
my pockets snug, they can't hold my 7
they banned my visa, my amex and mastercards
i got new money, and it's all cash
i got new bags, and they all collabs
i rubber band a bunch of thousand-dollar delta gift cards
amazing, the cash online unknown
blazing the dash, counting money at home
 
i heard through the grapevine
that great love, it takes time
sex shapes the body, truth shapes the mind
candle light dinner, fish and chips with the vinegar
with a glass of cold stout or wine or something similar
swim the english channel to the italian peninsula
her strong pheromones with cologne enhance the stench of her
but she asked for romance, I'm deep into her
don’t let her fall, always remember us
don't marry him, no no no no no
don't marry him
don't marry him, don't carry him to paradise
don't let them throw the dice
don't let them throw the rice
don’t turn my soul deep into the poltergeist
his heart turns cold like it was soaked in ice
melt inside the heat of my passion
magnetic attraction, to cause a strong reaction
i need you like I need satisfaction
i need you like I need satisfaction
 
let your man know that
mr. steal your girl is back
so let your man know that
mr. steal your girl is back
i’m back
 
ooh, late night

back of my mind, I'm hoping you say two or three 
you look good, we came to party
but I don't wanna waste my time 
 
i got it in the worst way
got me trapped in your love cage
listen, listen
your eyes don't glisten, glisten
like they used to
and this ain't something that I'm used to, no
 
all the times when I know I should be smiling
seem to be the time that I frown the most
can't believe that we're still surviving
'cause I'm slowly breaking down even when I hold you close
and if I lose you, I'm afraid I would lose who
who I gave my love to
that's the reason I stay around
even though I fell way
 
na, na na, na na, na...
na, na na, na na, na...
 
respect you too much not to be one hundred with you
you deserve the world and me running with you

don't be afraid to tell me that it's over
tell me that it's over

there's too many things, I can't look you in the face
i just grab you by the waist and act like everything's okay
bare with me girl, I'm trying to be honest
tell you what you need to hear, just not yet
i'm barely getting started, I'm being cautious
girl that's the hardest
all we been through, look what we've been through
look at jay and bey, they going through some shit too
we made it through the struggle let's make it through this too
i got a confession, baby will you listen to it?
 
it feels like a thousand pounds of weight holding your body down in a pool of water, barely reaching your chin
 
yeah, like rambo 
they begging for mercy, like the lambo 
know they told me kill 'em all, goddamn, though
i know they want to see me fall, look where I am, though 
on two feet, that's where I stand, though
i'm a true fucking killer, like rambo
no ammo, they see me on the sanyo
nigga, I just kill 'em 'cause I can
 
until your soul lets me in
oooh, ooh

it's the smell of your hair
and it's the way that we feel
i've never felt comfortable like this
 
i wanna know how we became so distant girl
the way we fell in love it was almost instant
i'm tryna find a way around it
girl tell me how you feel about it

thank god I would have never found this, I doubt it
i'm there for you if you allow it
girl you know I gotta keep you around me
all this paper we counting, blazing these ounces
spending on you baby no matter what the amount is
now you wanna know what's gotten into me, what's changed?
i guess I had a hard time showing it at first but
 
she saw every hand in my pocket
she sold her gold rush
she watched me lose face every day
rather than lose me
she was the gold rush, she was the gold rush
she was the gold rush, she was the gold rush
she was the gold rush, she was the gold rush
 
i don't have a type
if I did, it would be you
i think you're perfect for me
running after love is the last thing that I do
but you know, I'm running around
cause I don't, stop playing around
you know you know you know it

i don't know about my love
i don't know about my loving anymore
all that I know is
i'm falling, falling, falling, falling
might as well fall in
 
well maybe I should study my reflection
best to know
how I seem, I seem, I seem
i spend the day
dreaming of connection
just to feel
how you feel, you feel, you feel
 
but baby, don't get it twisted
you was just another nigga on the hit list
tryna fix your inner issues with a bad bitch
didn't they tell you that I was a savage?

never told you you could have it
 
i wanna taste your sweat, force my fingers in your mouth

the best song wasn't the single
but you couldn't turn your radio down
satellite need a receiver, can't seem to turn the signal fully off
transmitting the waves
you're catching that breeze 'til you're dead in the grave
but you're keeping it surreal, whatever you like
whatever feels good, whatever takes you mountain high
keeping it surreal, not sugar-free
my tv ain't hd, that's too real
grapevines, mango, peaches, and lime, a sweet life
 
you've had a landscaper and a house keeper since you were born 
the starshine always kept you warm
so why see the world, when you got the beach?
don't know why see the world, when you got the beach?
the sweet life
 
i know you've had to accept, yeah
apologies you haven't gotten yet
that makes things hard to forget 
i know, hope you aren't telling your friends
that you need, more water, less stress, more sex, less of me
looking for someone more mature than me
somebody else who can keep better habits and
you're not having it
 
make every day our love season
dirty lover you are my rider
that should be enough reason
call you baby that's only your title
'cause I don't need no more rivals
i put that on the bible
you're the only thing that I want
 
now we on the balcony chillin'
she loving the view when we smoke, I'm loving it too while I stroke
got the stars looking down on us, do it 'til the sunrise up
beat, beat, beat, take a drink, go to sleep, she a freak, she can get it right up, get it right up
man shorty like the energizer
she just wanna ride, she ain't never tired
she cooking naked, eggs and some bacon
after I eat that, I treat that, then eat that again, and again, and again
 
don't it feel good when I touch on it?
wouldn't it be nice if all night I was in you?
come kiss me, come with me, down the hall to my bedroom
tonight we'll be
 
she said she like it when I'm nasty

she feel me deep in her chest
top of the morn', she give me top
i be so deep in her neck
i be so deep, she be wet
we take the sheets out the bed
up in that pussy like I thought it was a trap
she let me do whatever when I'm digging her out
hang her head off the bed, told her keep it right there
i fuck her face, she let me spit all in her mouth
then I put my fingers in her holes in and out
pretty motherfucker suck her soul right out
i got that pussy on my lips like chapstick
i beat that pussy like my grandma did bad kids
 
listen up
when I look at you, I see someone I don't deserve
then I pretend like my vision blurry
is it love I'm searching for? or different word?
looked at me, said, "when did this occur?"
soon as I seen you in mini skirt
soon as you hit me with smile first
soon as I heard how your mind works
me and my girl, we just diverted
we just went our separate ways, yeah
knew she loved me 'cause I'm paid up
therefore I don't wanna make up
yeah, I saw something different in you
had to come and tell you straight up
you was headed for the door
had to tell you, "wait up"
like "aye, yo, hold up, wait up"
hold up, hold up
 
i fell in love with somebody, who doesn't even know my name
know my name, no, no
and I know this, I'm ashamed
by my name, I'm not talking 'bout the name you call me, I'm talking 'bout who I am
and I know you don't know my name 
she knows the songs that I sing, all the shit that I claim
and even the set that I bang, but I'm certain she don't know
i'm tryna figure it out, but if she's walking out
she will never know my name, can't let her go
 
my girl might leave me if she hears about this
la confidential, la confidential
i hope she never has to hear about this
la confidential, oh
 
you was on the verge of losing her
you was acting like you ain't want shit to do with her
i cut out the bullshit and kept it true with her
that's why the sexual tension is high when I'm in rooms with her
she really the shit, I don't be juicing her
i'm the shit too, that's why I'm so in tune with her
i feel like I'm sewn on ya
i feel like you grew on me
have I grown on you?
done fronting like I don't want you
keep treating me like I don't know you
back and forth between me and all your niggas
you're busy tonight, that figures
tonight you're staying in his city
and still I answer your call when he doesn't answer at all
but I want that too, that's all
i need the same in return, that's all
 
got a lotta class
whole lotta ass
i don't care if y'all hoes get mad
just don't get in the way everyday
girl you know I gotta brag
my bitch in tip top shape
i like how her lip gloss taste
stop playing, get rid of ole boy
cause when tiller deploy, girl that nigga dead weight
 
i ain't tryna think about it, no
yeah, I said it, boy, get up inside it
i want you to homicide it
go in slow, but I want you to pipe it
and I think I kinda like ya
up against the wall, we don't need a title
 
tell me 'bout your picture-perfect love
tell me how you think without the drugs
maybe you just need to send for me
i don't mean to really love ya
i don't mean to even care about ya
i don't mean to really love ya
i don't mean to really care about ya, no more
i don't mean to really care about ya, no more
 
and it's not your fault
it's so wrong, it's so wrong, it's so wrong
 
i think that she's a winner
she could be a keeper
 
now how shit begins, don't represent the end
it's not always what it's about
there’s ups and downs, to the east and the west
sometimes it's north and south
i'm praying for her on my knees
and I hope to god, hope that he can hear me
don't let her get caught up now
cause the world out there is less forgiving
 
a tornado flew around my room before you came

southern california, much like arizona

and I drop the top on all these niggas in the way
and this is for the times a nigga shitted on me

our skin like bronze and our hair like cashmere

chandeliers inside the pyramids, tremble from the force

he don't fuck with niggas 'cause niggas is the reason
he got himself inside of this situation in the first place
he had no father figure, he told me that his papa got shot in the face
and he can't wait to find out who his killer
he dedicated his life and now wants to know this
to find out who had a motive to kill his only father
he felt, it had to be somebody close
it couldn't be somebody far away that didn't know him, but take this part in
when he was younger, he used to roll with his cousin
a woman that used to show him the ropes
she used to tell him
"don't ever let no nigga or woman touch you
and if somebody do then all they would hear was the baka-baka-baka-baka"
one day, he was on the block rollin'
then, this crack fiend woman came to him, told him
that she was his mother, man, that shit had him frozen
he ain't want to believe her 'til she said, "boy, you got a birthmark above your scrotum
a scar up on your eye came from when you was four
when you fell off in the road"
at that point, he looked at her face and he froze
she told him hold on, it's something she gotta show him
she says to him, "i was gon' wait until you got older
but something was on my mind, was pressin', I had to show you
the whole block know me and the whole block know you
the whole block been knew this story but they ain't told you"
his mom says to him, "i hope you know your pop was a good man
but he just had some nonsense to him
huh, well, one night, he's fucked up on the pills
i'm tryna tell him stop but everything I'm saying fails
you see, your lil' cousin in brooklyn where we would leave ya, uh
i know she love you but the story's more deeper, uh
you see, your father used to be a creeper
he used to fuck her, used to touch her, used to beat her
used to leave her so confused she would lace her own coke and reefer
wait, I know you wanna interrupt but this get deeper
you've been living this mission, you tryna figure who's the nigga
or the perpetrator of killing your pops, nigga?
when your cousin is the reason he got shot, nigga
she put six shots in him out the glock, nigga"
his anger was dwelling all on his mind
he didn't know what to do, he started gripping his .9
and uh, before he knew it, he aimed it up at his mom
and uh, huh- gun shots -he shot her right in the spine
he said, "this is why my life has been full of lies
don't nobody care for me, fuck it, what's the use in tryin'?
this glock on my side, if I put it to my mind
i know that I'ma die but in heaven, I'll be alive" gun shot
 
oh
baby, you got it all
sexy from her head to toe
and I want it all, it all, it all
 
remember me, though I have to say goodbye
remember me, don't let it make you cry
for even if I'm far away, I hold you in my heart
i sing a secret song to you each night we are apart
remember me, though I have to travel far
remember me, each time you hear a sad guitar
