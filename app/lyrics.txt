and nobody cares like you do 
you asked for my heart, but I didn't know where to start 
but they won't think of you like I do 
 
tell 'em this boy wasn't made for loving
tell 'em this heart doesn't stay to one
i'll be the same, never changed for nothing

cause every woman that loved me, oh yeah
seemed to push them away
that's real life, oh oh oh
real life, ooh
mama talking that real life, oh oh oh
that real life, real life, real life, real life

heard shorty's been needing the rest of my mind
 
tell me how you fell when  
to my life, to my life
remember life to my life
don't be back, you for life
to my life, you will love
to my life, to my life
you for life, ohh

chest feeling heavy like a midget on my necklace
bitches that we came with got all of your bitches jealous 
'bout to leave the crib with a couple of my pirates
driving by the streets we used to walk through like a triumph
mix it in a potion like a science
that liquid g diet got a nigga so quiet
cause the shit so strong, got me feeling like I'm dying
the shit so raw, nothing else can get me higher
only time you see me's when I'm balling with my niggas
cause my life too private, my ride too private 
my flight too private, my shows so riot
my jaw so tired, I go all night in my city 'til the fall
then it's time for me to fly out
i got a girl at home even though she ain't mine yet
 
i'm just coming back to let you know 
i could never say it on the phone 
will never let you go this time

i'ma let you get  
you been picking my voice to dance to

even though I didn't ask you
and it's the most you've worked
even though I probably don't deserve this girl
but you been dreaming for this moment so you have to
baby, it's ok
i got show money, baby
i wanna show you how I blow money, baby
i wanna show you how I throw money, baby
i'm a kid, so it's hard for me to hold money, baby
cause I'm a star, don't get it twisted
got some trappers in my car
what kind of caps I got the brownest of them all
somebody pop 'em before we pop 'em all, before we pop 'em all
 
so a nigga leaving, leaving, leaving into the night
now a nigga leaving, leaving
leaving into the night, oh
 
 
we all getting fucked up
i been making nothin'
i been making something
 
i'm tired of being home alone 
i used to have a girl a day 
but I want you to stay 
you said you might be into girls 
said you're going through a phase 
keeping your heart safe 
well, baby, you can bring a friend 
she can ride on top your face 
while I fuck you straight 
 
said I'm just tryna swim in something wetter than the ocean
faded off a double cup, I'm mixing up the potion
all I wanna do is make that money and make dope shit
it just seem like niggas tryna sound like all my old shit
everybody knows it, all these niggas know me
platinum off a mixtape, sipping on that codeine
pour it in my trophies, roll until my nose bleed
i'ma keep on singing while I'm burning up that og
all my niggas get it, they make money all alone
rock a chain around they neck, making sure I'm getting home
when I travel 'round the globe, make a couple mil' a show
and I come back to my city, I fuck every girl I know
used to walk around with a slouch, had a mattress on the floor
now my shit straight
eating all day, tryna lose weight
that good sex, we'll sweat it out
hotel bed springs, we'll wear it out
i ain't gotta tell you 'cause—
 
there are certain things that I've come to understand
expectations can kill a simple man, a simple man
i try to master the art, of that far away love
but only so much can keep a woman warm
now it's times like this that I say to myself
we've been living in a cold, cold world, cold world
but at least I have you to rely
even if for a short time
as long as you know when I land you're mine
 
i was broken, I was broken, I was so broke
i used to walk around the town when I was homeless 
me and lamar would rob a nigga for his jordans
and flip it just to get these hoes another nose fix 
now we get faded when we want, girl, we got choices
lay them on the fucking table, we got choices 
and if she wanna fuck my niggas, she got choices
i told her not to fall in love, that shit is pointless
 
and keep it on that xo 
nobody has to know, has to know
not your momma, not your sister, not your daddy
just keep it on that xo 
nobody has to know, has to know, has to know, oh
 
never need a bitch, I'm'what'a bitch need'
tryna find the one that'can fix me
i've been dodging death in the six-speed
amphetamine got my stummy feeling sickly
yeah, I want it all now
i've been running through the pussy, need a dog pound
hundred models getting faded in the compound
tryna love me, but they never get a pulse down 
 
 
in your eyes
i see there's something burning inside you
oh, inside you
in your eyes
i know it hurts to smile, but you try to
oh, you try to
you always try to hide the pain
you always know just what to say
i always look the other way
i'm blind, I'm blind
in your eyes
you lie, but I don't let it define you
oh, define you
 
look what you've done
i’m a motherfucking starboy
look what you've done
i'm a motherfuckin’ starboy
 
i'm gone...
i'm gone...
i'm gone...
i'm gone...
 
so who do you belong to now? 
who you give that love to now? 
who you pulling up on?
who you getting sprung for now? 
and what they got that I ain't got? 'cause I got a lot 
don't make me run up on 'em, got me blowing up their spot 
'cause I ain't got no business catching feelings anyway
i ain't got no business catching feelings 
 

so long, and I know, it took all night, all night 
so long, and I know, it took all night, all night 
so long, and I know, it took all night, all night

ohh, ayy 
 
when'a'shock turns a'stare
into a smile
and a smile slips'off the strap
from her dress
she has no confidence
she'fears'his'holiness
her life is'nothing but a'test
cause the bible commands her to resist the things she most appreciates
so she hides all her demons with her makeup
hoping that he'll open the gates
 
she pulled up to the studio
nobody's watching
she closed the door and then she locked it
for me, for me
we had sex in the studio
nobody walked in
i cut my verse and then she popped it
for me, for me
oh-oh, oh-oh
 
oh, oh, oh
no, no, no, no, no, no
no, no, no, no, no, no
no, no, no, no, no, no
no, no, no, no, no, no
no, no, no, no, no, no
no, no, no, no, no, no
no, no, no, no, no, no
no, no, no, no, no, no
yeah
lyrics from snippet
 
i haven't been around my town in a long while
i apologize, but i
i've been trying to get this money like I got a couple kids who rely
on me
but I remember on the bathroom floor
'fore I went on tour
like you said we couldn't do it again
cause you had a thing with some other man
you said it was love
and you said you were lost
then you wished me good luck
to find somebody to love
but, oooh
now I've heard that you're single
and uh huh, I'll give you something to live for
yes, I will
 
and I'ma be god, and I'ma be god
and I'ma be god, and I'ma be god
and I'ma be god, and I'ma be god
and I'ma be god, and I'ma be god 
and I'ma be god, and I'ma be god
and I'ma be god, and I'ma be god
and I'ma be god, and I'ma be god
and I'ma be god, and I'ma be god 
and I'ma be god, and I'ma be god
and I'ma be god, and I'ma be...
 
i feel the blood rushing throughout ya body
you see the scars painted over my skin
i'm always numb to the topic of lovin'
i fell in love with the subject of sin
 
i saw you dancing in a crowded room, uh
you look so happy when I'm not'with'you
but then you'saw me, caught you by surprise
a'single teardrop falling from your eye
 
light a blunt up with the flame
put'that'cocaine on a'plate
molly with the purple rain
'cause I'lost my faith
so I cut away the pain, uh
got it'swimming'in'my veins
now my'mind is outta'place, yeah, uh
'cause I lost my faith
 
you know me 
you know me, know me 
you know man, know man 
you know me, know me 
every time you try to forget who I am 
i'll be right there to remind you again 
you know me

'cause I love you
and I need you
i only want you
and nobody's going to know if it's true
'cause I love you
and I need you
i only want you
and nobody's going to know if it's true
 
i wanna cut you outta my dreams 
i wanna cut you outta my mind 
i say a prayer  everytime I close my eyes 
you sounding sad 'cause-
i wanna cut you, I wanna cut you
i wanna cut you, I wanna cut you out
 , call me little homie
faded off of codeine, rolling till my nose bleed
hitting off of nothing while I blow through that og
i know it will be a long 
i know something you don't know, eh
i'm here to take you 
tell me that you do it I don't mean
oh, I've been in love
while I want everybody to see through love
oh, thank you all the time
take me through the night
xo
 
but I showed that I got it all for'you
save'you love, where' 
so call out my name 
call out my name when I kiss you so gently
i want you to stay 
i want you to stay even though you don't want me
girl, why can't you wait? 
girl, why can't you wait 'til I fall out of love?
won't you call out my name? 
girl, call out my name, and I'll be on my way and
i'll be on my—
 
i'm not a fool
i just love that you're dead inside 
i'm not a fool, I'm just lifeless too
but you taught me how to feel
when nobody ever would
and you taught me how to love
when nobody ever could
 
six inch long, 'bout three inch wide 
dolla, dolla bill is her only type 
you love her but you'll never be 
the one, the one
diamonds and the rings are her fantasy 
she chase hearts with the hennessy 
you love her, but you'll never be 
enough, enough
 
she always leaves the man she loves
but the diamonds are forever
she always seems to be alone
but the diamonds make it better
 
i'ma touch you right 
ooh, I'ma touch you right
ooh, I'ma touch you right
ohh ahh, ahh

i'm flying down, to shut it down
you tryna buy your ticket to me,  
i look around and
sin city's cold and empty 
no one's around to judge me 
i can't see clearly when you're gone
 
i said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
no, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
hey, hey, hey
hey, hey, hey
 
when the sun comes up, you're searching for a love
so your heart won't lead you to anyone
when the sun goes down, I know what you become
you become awake, unlike the rest of us
 
till you're motionless
and your body getting numb from the sex and the rum
till she motionless
you just wanna be with me
till you're motionless
and your body get numb, you just wanna be touched
till you're motionless, till you're motionless
 
and even though we live inside
a dangerously empty life
you always seem to bring the light
you always seem to bring the light
and even though we live inside
a dangerously empty life
you always seem to bring me light
you always seem to bring me light
 
i don't sleep no more , no more 
i don't sleep no more , no more 
i don't sleep no
i don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't

i'm just tryna get you out the friend zone
'cause you look even better than the photos
i can't find your house, send me the info
driving through the gated residential
found out I was comin', sent your friends home
keep on tryna hide it but your friends know

baby, you know just what I like
 
i never lied when I cried for you
and I know you cry too 
you're reading minds, just couldn't deny you do
always hard to say bye to you 
love the way you're talkin', love your style, but, ooh, babe
we know that you got it from me
and it's haunting you deep, too hard not to see it
hate the way I feel love, only hurts with real love
and it's taking every part of me, when you look, I could see love
one day, I'm giving you space
and the next day, you're giving me faces
and I like parties, not this place
it's coming out of my bag for you to get wasted
i 
it's like I forgot that staring is rude
and that's what five shots could turn me into 
but you've done most things that gentlemens do, so 
 
in your eyes
i see there's something burning inside you
oh, inside you
you always try to hide the pain
you always know just what to say
i always look the other way
i'm blind, I'm blind
in your eyes

but tonight I'm gon' let you know

her intention is the paper

shots of tequila, bottles of patron
blunts to the face, you don't wanna sing no'more
lost'your c notes
cabbed'all day, took the bus back'home
eviction on your door

don't you blame it on me
'cause I get it, you're built like a goddess
and you  
mina mörkaste timmar
tjejen, jag kände mig så ensam inuti detta trånga rum
olika tjejer på golvet, distraherar mina tankar av dig
jag förändrades till den mannen jag brukade vara, vara
tog mig själv till sömns
bara så att jag kunde bli närmre dig I mina drömmar
ville inte vakna upp om du inte var bredvid mig
jag ville bara ringa och säga, och säga

 
i just want to see you shine 'cause I know you are a star, girl
i just want to see you shine 'cause I know you are a star, girl
i just want to see you shine 'cause I know you are a star, girl

so don't be scared to live again, baby

tryna find the one that'can fix me
i've been dodging death in the six-speed
amphetamine got my stummy feeling sickly
yeah, I want it all now
i've been running through the pussy, need a dog pound
hundred models getting faded in the compound
tryna love me, but they never get a pulse down
 
they all feel the same
adjust to the fame, ooh
'cause no one will love you, like her
it's pointless
like tears in the rain 
so now that she's gone 
embrace all that comes 
and die with a smile
don't show the world how alone you've become 
they all feel the same
 
house so empty, need a centerpiece
20 racks a table cut from ebony
cut that ivory into skinny pieces
then she clean it with her face man I love my baby
you talking money, need a hearing aid
you talking bout me, I don't see the shade
switch up my style, I take any lane
i switch up my cup, I kill any pain
 
she lick it up just like a candy
she wanna make them leave their family
she trying to live a life so fancy
she wanna pull up in a bentley
she ain't got time for lovin'
louis vuitton her husband
she rather die in lusting
she rather die in the club, 'til she
 
you were on top, I put you on top
i claimed you so proud and openly, babe
and when times were rough, when times were rough
i made sure I held you close to me
 
i never prayed a moment in my life
girl, I'm rewarded with you
i've been rewarded with you
so baby let me kiss your inner thigh
let me kiss it for you
i can kiss it for you
 
there's no need to hide
don't overreact
you said you've been to the sky
we'll go beyond that
you've been here before, girl
remember these sheets
this world's not for us
it's not what it seems
 
i ran out of tears when I was 18
so nobody made me but the main streets
'cause too many people think they made me
well, if they really made me then replace me
homeless to forbes list, these niggas bring no stress
i feel like moses, I feel like I'm chosen
and if you ain't my nigga then your girl single to me
i don't give a damn if a nigga said he knew me
grew up with no father so nobody ever "son" me
my flow too sick, kevin costner couldn't touch me
i know you wish that nobody ever love me
i feel useless when I'm never making money
well, this the life we always fantasized
rich folk problem through a queen street nigga's eyes
every time you see me pulling up in aventadors

i hurt some I know inside
 
girl, I know you  
wanna fuck a skinny model right before her runway show
she the one in the back, nose running from the blow
and we did it on the floor, that's why she walking kind of funny
should've never put us on, bitch I'm only 24
and everybody salty, niggas stop your bitchin'
everybody making money, we don't need to kick it
i'm chilling with my niggas, everybody got a crib
did an album just to do it, dropping albums like a pill
percocets, adderall, ecstasy, pussy, money, weed
faded for a week, I don't sleep, fuck my enemies
try to stay sane is like a full-time hobby
everything I do, fake niggas always copy
all I want to do is go on tour and drop albums
and if I live forever, probably drop a hundred thousand
dick made out of magic, my tongue got superpowers
i woke up in the mornin', models passed out in the shower
 
hello, welcome to the other side
you're lost
baby step outside your mind
you've been really good
you've been really good
you've been thinking bout being bad ever since I put you on
she got money for blow
just check her damn nose
prescription ain't an issue
you can mix it with the oh
and if you wanna do it, baby
i'm right here with you
i'm on cloud nine
baby you're behind
you can follow me
you can follow me if you want
 
she tricking on herself, she don't need a boss
then you know, it really ain't a thing to flaunt
that two door, stunting with the ceilings off
got these bitches in their feelings 'cause she played it off
used to have a man, wasn't meant to be 
made 100 bands that's a century 
saving up for plans that would never be
she already made enough but she'll never leave
 
nothing compares , to the emptiness we both share 
nobody cares like you do 
you asked for my heart , but I didn't know where to start 
but they won't think of you like I do 
 
i hope you know that, I hope you know that
i've been praying that you find yourself
i hope you know that, I hope you know that
we fell apart, right from the start
 
don't you mess with me
don't you mess with me
the way I kissed your scars
the way I fixed your heart, oh
don't you miss me, babe?
don’t you miss me, baby?
 
saying this ain't nothing, but it's all I need
and the peak ain't reached but the peak is all I feel
and it feels so good
it feels so good
it feels so good

it's a little too late to apologize now
so forget how, you talked about your ex to me
how you would forget about him, bullshit you see
your dumbass isn't gonna forget that easily
'member when I said I'll call you, well...

skydd, vi inte kommer behöva
din kropp bredvid mig
är bara ett minne
jag faller in för djupt, åh
utan dig, kan jag inte somna
sömnlöshet lindra, åh
prata med mig, utan dig, kan jag inte andas

and we lost a lot of things in the fire 
so it took a year for me to find out

but she told me that to love her is so crazy
 
she's stacking money, money everywhere she goes
you know, pesos out of mexico
de uno, commas and them decimals
she don't gotta give it up, she professional
she mixing up that ace with that hennessy
she love the way it tastes, that's her recipe
rushing through her veins like it's ecstasy, oh no
then she killed the fucking stage like an enemy

nobody needs to fall in love
'cause I'm just a bird 
girl, I'm just another bird 
don't make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me
nobody needs to fall in love
 
we're no good'for each other, no good for each other
we're no good for each other
 
 
and keep it on the down low 
 nobody has to know 
keep it on the down low 
 nobody has to know 
 
but I chose the life
i chose the life
then I realized
she might have been the one
i let it go
for a little fun
i made a trade
gave away our days
for a little fame
now I'll never see your face
but it's okay I adapted anyway
 
my darkest hours
girl, I felt so alone inside of this crowded'room
different'girls on the'floor, distracting my thoughts of you
i'turned into the man I used to be, to be
put'myself'to'sleep
just so I'can get closer'to you inside my dreams
didn't wanna wake up 'less you were beside me
i just wanted to call you and say, and say
 
so don't you fall in love
don't make me make you fall in love
don't make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me
nobody needs to fall in love
i swear I'm just a bird
girl, I'm just another bird
don't make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me
like me  
 
adapted to these models
who's adapted to the bottle
they take it down like water
just to burn away their sorrows
i'll stay up till tomorrow
just to tear down all their morals
and all is fair in love and war
she's pure
 
to go downtown with the drugs in your body
take that step you’re the life of the party
know that step you’re the life of the party
 
thought I almost died in my dream again 
fighting for my life, I'couldn't'breathe again
i'm fallin''in too deep 
without you,'i can't sleep 
'cause my heart belongs to you
i'll risk it all for you
i want you next to me
this time, I'll never leave
i wanna share babies
protection, we won't need
your body next to me
is just a memory
i'm falling in too deep, oh
without you, I can't sleep
insomnia relieve, oh
talk to me, without you, I can't breathe
 
don't stop your lovin', it's all I have
don't stop for nothin', do it on time
but what I'm before, you know what happens
'cause I know what's pain, this is not the same
 
light one up, let me bum a smoke
still coming down, dripping throat
i got another man's blood on my clothes
but it ain't his fault, it's the life I chose
 
she's stacking money, money everywhere she goes
you know, pesos out of mexico
de uno, commas and them decimals
she don't gotta give it up, she professional
she mixing up that ace with that hennessy 
she love the way it tastes, that's her recipe 
rushing through her veins like it's ecstasy
then she kill the fucking stage like an enemy
 
in the night she hears him calling
in the night she's dancing to relieve the pain
she'll never walk away
i don't think you understand
in the night when she comes crawlin'
dollar bills and tears keep falling down her face
she'll never walk away
i don't think you understand
 
na-na-na-na-na
oh-oh-oh
yeah, yeah
'cause girl, you're perfect
the way you work it
you deserve it
girl, you deserve it
girl, you earned it, yeah, yeah
  take a bit of practice
i  
go downtown with the drugs in your body
take that step you’re the life of the party
know that step you’re the life of the party
 
you don't love him, you don't love him
you don't love him if you're thinking of'me
you'don't love him,'you're just fucking
you're just fucking, it'means nothing to me
you don't love him, you don't love'him
you'don't'love him if'you're thinking of'me
you don't love him, you're just fucking
you're just fucking, it means nothing to me, yeah
 
i know things will never be the same
time we've lost will never be replaced
i'm the reason you forgot to love
 
all alone, she was livin'
in a world without an end or beginnin'
baby girl was living life for the feelin'
but I don't mind, I don't mind, oh
and all the wrongs she committed
she was numb and she was so co-dependent
she was young and all she had was the city
but I don't mind, I don't mind
 
"i've been in love, but I know" you're saying
"i've been living down every note" you're saying
"i don't mean enough, but I know" you're saying
"i've been taking all you know, but I know" you're saying
 ooh, and "i know" you're saying 
 ooh, and "i know" you said 
 
i know everything
i know everything
i know everything
i know everything
 
'cause I'm heartless 
and I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
all this money and this pain got me heartless
low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
said I'm heartless
tryna be a better man, but I'm heartless
never be a wedding plan for the heartless
low life for life 'cause I'm heartless

i just wanted to call you and say, and say

pocket full of ones with the zeros in a pair
find myself staring at your waist

on my superman shit
x-ray visions while you shaking those hips 
 
hills have eyes, the hills have eyes
who are you to judge, who are you to judge?

only you to trust, only you
 
i can take you away 
from the darkness and the pain 
girl, I promise every moment's for you
show you never ending love 
i can bring it from above 
i can heal your wounds
 
valerie 
i know you can see through me
valerie 
you just choose to never know
valerie
why pretend to trust in me?
valerie 
you'd rather this than be alone
 
ooh girl, I know I should leave you
and learn to mistreat you
'cause you belong to the world, ooh yeah
and ooh girl, I want to embrace you
domesticate you
but you belong to the world
 
cause unlike you, I got nothing to hide
i don't pretend to have any shame
i got a box you can put all your lies in
until the end of days
and know that I will be a call away
the call you'll make when you're all alone
and I know that I will always be the one
you repent when you are done

where you belong, where you belong
where you belong, where you belong
where you belong, where you belong
where you belong, where you belong
where you belong, where you belong
where you belong, where you belong
where you belong, where you belong
where you belong, where you belong
to my fans
i want to thank you for listening and being patient for as long as you have. no matter what an artist's ego clouds them to believe, you are the reason why I have been able to continue to do what I love to do and that is to entertain you. my journey for inspiration may seem like masochism to others who have not been given the task to make art, but best believe it brings me nothing but joy
because I am a man of few words, I chose to make a viral video to show you how I felt and where I stand. I usually don't like to "spoon feed" my audience because I grew up idolizing story tellers who tell stories using symbolism, so it was in my nature to do the same. the rolling stone video takes place in a dimly lit studio which represents the two worlds I have been stuck in. the gloomy side represents the mainstream world while the other side represents the underground. the girl holding on represents you. as the world slowly gets familiar with my face the more you will lose interest . the camera lights symbolize the crossover, and when they begin to flash I look away from the underground. even though I don't want to, it is a step that I feel I must take to evolve as an artist
this predicament is impossible to relate to unless you are put in that unique situation. I want you to know and understand that this does not mean what you think it means, and I made sure of that in my deal. you will continue to get what you fell in love with, and I will continue to give you what you ask for. I'll never make you wait again. with that being said expect more from me very soon leading up to trilogy. thank you again for your patience and loyalty, I will not disappoint
sincerely

ain't the kind of girl you'll be seeing in the morning
too damn raw, ain't no nigga with her rollin'
ain't no nigga that she holding
man, her love is too damn foreign
look at all that money
the money is the motive 
all that money
the money she be folding 
girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
 
sometimes life go on
get cold, oh, oh, woah
i was a  
and I'ma fuck the pain away, and I know I'll be okay
they said our love is just a game, I don't care what they say
but I'ma drink the pain away, I'll be back to my old ways
and I got two red pills to take the blues away, oh
 
i don't seem to have you niggas 'round me
all I do is cut niggas from 'round me
and they know the reason why they got cut
you can lie to the press just to get a buzz
'cause these niggas know that I do everything
puppet master over heads, I'm pulling strings
nigga, I'm the reason everybody getting high
singing slow, rocking camo tees and white hoes
but they can have it, I touch any lane

arenas in the spring, I'm hella paid
that means hella face, hella mouth, hella brain
these bitches going hard, they losing shame
i got 'em training like they losing weight
i'm in miami, I fuck every day
i never slow the pace, this shit's a throwaway
 
when it's said and done
i already felt love
and I let it end up
end up dying by itself
and when it's said and done
you were better off
you deserve real love
and I deserve to be by myself
'cause I've gone too far
and I started too young
to give up
and even if I changed
it would be too late
i exposed my ways
now every girl I touch
 
tell me we're faded, you know faded to toe
i'm making a toast
rolling and spinning a jay, rolling and pour one
i'm making a toast
standing my body and tote
i'm making you boat, I'm making you know

i was singing notes while my niggas played with six keys
walking in the snow before I ever made my wrist freeze
i was blowing smoke, had me dizzy like gillespie
niggas had no homes, we were living in the dead streets
you couldn't find me like I'm hoffa
cover girls jumping out the page like they pop ups
spending all my money on these niggas that I brought up
taking care of families for my brothers when they locked up
and I had nothing to believe in
double cup leanin'
couldn't even breathe and
for that money I was fiending
cali was the mission but now a nigga leaving

good girls go to heaven
and bad girls go everywhere
and tonight I will love you
and tomorrow you won't care
 
but tonight i’m going home, waiting for a love
so after this rendezvous, might as well be dead to you

and she'll always get the best of me
the worst is yet to come
but at least we'll both be beautiful and stay forever young

what makes you think that you can ever do me right
 
i got a brand new place, I think I've seen it twice all year
i can't remember how it looks inside
so you can picture how my life's been
i went from staring at the same four walls for 21 years
to seeing the whole world in just 12 months
been gone for so long I might have just found god
well, probably not, if I keep my habits up
probably not if I can't keep up with lovin'
and I can't stand talking to brand new girls
only bitches down to fuck when you shower them with ones
probably not if my niggas round them up
probably not if we take 'em to my spot
probably not if I tweak all day just to sleep at night
goddamn, I'm high
my doctor told me to stop
and he gave me something to pop
and I mix it up with some adderall's
and I wait to get to the top
and I mix it up with some alcohol and I pour it up in a shot
i don't care about you, why you worried 'bout me?
all I want is that smoke, give me all of that smoke
last week was my rough week
i'm still dripping down from my nose
and I don't know how to drive, I make my driver get high

what we got here
how we fucking got here
they recognized
they just recognize
i'm in a life without a home so this recognition's not enough
i don't care about nobody else
cause I've been on these streets way too long, too long, too long

she's got her confidant
her friend don't like men
but does what evelyn says
and right beside her bedside
in a miniskirt that isn't ever hers
they may call it the bedside
it's the only side I hope that she preserves
 
dirty diana, no, dirty diana, no
dirty diana, no, dirty diana, let me be!
oh no... oh no... oh no...
 
so don't you fall in love
don't make me make you fall in love
don't make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me
like me
'cause, girl, I'm just a bird
girl, I'm just another bird
don't make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me
like me
 
what does it mean, oh
when your heart's already numb
you're professional
won't treat it like it's personal
no, 'cause it's just love
it always makes its way back around
it's dispensable
to fall is unacceptable
'cause everything you've been through made you stronger
and every day you learn about yourself
and nothing really played out how it's supposed to
depending on somebody else's wealth
but now you know the value of a dollar
and girl I make enough of it to spend
i love the way you've put yourself together
i love the way you make that body bend
for me again, oh yeah
 
i feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
i feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
i feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
i feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
 
she don't depend on anybody
know just what to do with her own body
counting all that money like a hobby
she don't give a fuck about nobody
and she got her whole crew poppin'
and she bend it over like she got no back bone
got a couple niggas blinging up a trap phone
she don't need nobody waiting back home, she got it
 
if they don't let you in
you know where to find me
'cause if you wanna go again
you can always call me
'cause all we ever do is love
open up your mind, you can find the love
girl, you ain't alone
we all been alone
baby, just be honest
 
what do I gotta do, just to get your attention
when all I do is love you, oh you're just messin'
it's okay though, I'm used to it
but all those cuddles and kisses, yeah I'ma miss it
this ain't no break up song, I'm only saying what I feel
real lyrics so people can actually feel
what I go through, just to make someone happy
you bet I'm probably tired of it, but in reality
ain't no one's gonna be able to stop me
from loving anybody else, you see
i'm not obsessed, I'm only expressing myself
but that only leads to trouble, though...cause
 
i tell myself that I'll take you for the last time
i'll be over you eventually
time after time, you seem to brush me off
i understand what we have become
you wash your neck when you leave, now I know your routine
i was in love with your mystery
now I'll just take what I can get from you
i'm not embarrassed to be what you want me to be
 
i'm fucking gone right now
i'm fucking gone right now
"listen, listen"
 
it's been too long, you changed up over time
why you, why you gonna even try to hide?
it's natural to find someone to treat you right
but it ain't right if you fuck him out of spite
you don't have to cry, girl, let me wipe your eyes
your eyes, your eyes, your eyes
i promise you will always be mine
oh-oh, just repeat after me
 
we don't need your love, no more
said I'm gone, yeah I'm gone
you don't need to talk, no more
cause these kids already know
now these kids already know
said I'm gone, I'm gone
we don't need your love
i was broken, I was broken, I was so broke
i used to walk around the town when I was homeless
me and lamar would rob a nigga for his jordans
and flip it just to get these hoes up out those outfits
now we get faded while we walking with a joystick
they don't wanna -
 
convinced myself to run around with someone else to forget about you
but I can't hold'you'responsible for the'things I do
i said your name'by mistake, played it off like I'm just confused
but I'was'frontin','lying to myself'when I know'the truth
 
when I feel the love, did it safely
it's just everyone, ooh, yeah
not making up, 'cause I'm insane
now we know, on me, me
i'd be nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing without you
nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing without you
without you, without you, without you
 
my cousin said I made it big and it's unusual
she tried to take a selfie at my grandma's funeral
used to roam on queen, now I sing queen street anthems
used to hate attention, now I pull up in that wagon
i was broken, I was broken, I was so broke
i used to roam around the town when I was homeless
me and lamar would rob a nigga for his jordans
and flip it just to get these hoes another nose fix
now we get faded, when we want girl, we got choices
lay them on the fucking table, we got choices
and if they wanna fuck my niggas, they got choices
they told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless
yeah, that shit is pointless
they told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless
yeah, that shit is pointless
it's only meant to fall in love
that shit is pointless
 
when I saw the signs, I should've let you go
but I kept you beside me
and'if'i held you'back, at least I held you'close
should have known you were lonely
 
i love, you love
this love
we're professional
i know, you know
we're sophisticated
at loving...
 
this time I might not make it, I might not make it
this time I might not make it, I might not make it
i might not make it
this time I might not make it, I might not make it
 
cause unlike you, I got nothing to hide
i don't pretend to have any shame
i got a box you can put all your lies in
until the end of days
you know that I will be a call away
the call you'll make when you're all alone

cool
to my fans
i want to thank you for listening and being patient for as long as you have. no matter what an artist's ego clouds them to believe, you are the reason why I have been able to continue to do what I love to do and that is to entertain you. my journey for inspiration may seem like masochism to others who have not been given the task to make art, but best believe it brings me nothing but joy
because I am a man of few words, I chose to make a viral video to show you how I felt and where I stand. I usually don't like to 'spoon feed' my audience because I grew up idolizing story tellers who told stories using symbolism, so it was in my nature to do the same. the 'rolling stone' video takes place in a dimly lit studio which represents the two worlds I have been stuck in. the gloomy side represents the mainstream world while the other represents the underground. the girl holding on represents you. as the world slowly gets familiar with my face the more you will lose interest . the camera lights symbolize the crossover, and when they begin to flash I look away from the underground. even though I don't want to, it is a step that I feel I must take to evolve as an artist
this predicament is impossible to relate to unless you are put in that unique situation. I want you to know and understand that this does not mean what you think it means, and I made sure of that in my deal. you will continue to get what you fell in love with, and I will continue to give you what you ask for. I'll never make you wait again. with that being said expect more from me very soon leading up to 'trilogy'. thank you again for your patience and loyalty, I will not disappoint
sincerely

real love's hard to find
so she don't waste her time
so she don't waste her time, oooh
you ain't gon' catch her crying
she ain't gon' lose her mind
she ain't gon' lose her mind
'til she..
 
 
she likes the boys in the band, she knows when they come to town
every musician's fan after the, curtain comes down
she waits at backstage doors for those who have prestige
who promise fortune and fame, a life that's so carefree
she's saying that's ok, hey baby do what you want
i'll be your night loving thing, I'll be the freak you can taunt
and I don't care what you say, I want to go too far
i'll be your everything if you make me a star

especially since you know that this ain't nothing and I only just begun
 
why don't you run away, run away from him
and come running to me when you're on your knees
cause I will give the right solution
i can do is love you one last time
just to recollect memories in our mind
when everything is done don't act like you know me so well
i'll just be someone that you used to know
 
i know, yes, I know
yes, I know, yes, I know
yes, I know
baby 
i'm too far in this game to let go
so let go, so let go
 
wasted times I spent with someone else
she wasn't even half of you
reminiscing how you felt
reminiscing how you felt
and even though you put my life through hell
i can't seem to forget 'bout you, 'bout you
i want you to myself
